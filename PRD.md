# PDF Document Organizer - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
Managing personal and household documents after scanning/photographing is time-consuming. Users need a simple way to organize PDFs and images with consistent metadata tagging without complex workflows.

## Core Workflow
1. Point application at directory of PDFs/images
2. Application loads first document in queue
3. User reviews document preview
4. User either:
   - Manually edits metadata (title, subject, keywords)
   - Requests LLM analysis to suggest metadata values
5. User saves and moves to next document
6. Repeat until queue is processed

## Key Features

### Document Viewing
- Display PDF/image preview
- Show current embedded metadata
- Navigate through document queue with arrow keys/buttons

### Metadata Editing
- Edit title, subject, and keywords fields
- Tag-based keyword editor with add/remove functionality
- Keywords stored as comma-delimited values in PDF metadata

### AI-Assisted Organization
- LLM analyzes document content and structure
- Suggests values for: filename, title, subject, keywords
- Suggests split points for multi-page PDFs (e.g., detect document boundaries)
- User can accept, modify, or reject suggestions

### Tag Taxonomy
- Lightweight database (markdown file) of standardized tag slugs
- People registry: `fname-mname-lname` format
- Vendor/provider registry: categorized by type (retail, medical, financial, etc.)
- Validates suggested keywords against taxonomy

### Activity Log
- Track which documents were updated
- Record metadata changes
- Timestamp of updates

## Technical Constraints
- Simple, open-source solutions preferred
- Minimal dependencies
- Node.js stack
- PDF metadata stored in embedded PDF fields
- Comma-delimited keyword format (no spaces)

## Success Criteria
- User can process a batch of documents efficiently
- Metadata is consistently tagged using taxonomy
- Documents are searchable by embedded metadata
- Workflow is sustainable for quarterly batch processing

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority (Core Workflow Support)

**Phase 1: Essential Metadata Features**
- **Editing additional metadata fields**: Support editing author, creator, producer, and custom fields
- **XMP packet metadata syncing**: Sync metadata in XMP packet format in addition to legacy PDF info dictionary
  - Modern PDFs use XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) for richer metadata support
  - Sync metadata between XMP packet and legacy PDF info dictionary to ensure compatibility
  - Support XMP-specific fields and namespaces (Dublin Core, PDF, etc.)
  - Future-proof metadata storage while maintaining backward compatibility
- **PDF splitter mode**: Split multi-page PDFs into individual files, preserving metadata
  - **UI Flow**:
    - "Split" button appears in metadata section (only visible when PDF has more than 1 page)
    - Clicking "Split" navigates to splitter view
    - Splitter view displays all pages as thumbnails in a grid
    - User clicks between thumbnails to insert break markers
    - Break markers visually indicate where splits will occur
    - "Split PDF" button executes the split operation
    - Returns to main view after splitting
  - **File Naming**:
    - Auto-naming: Use AI suggestions or pattern-based naming (e.g., original-name-1.pdf, original-name-2.pdf)
    - Auto-numbering: Sequential numbering (e.g., original-name-001.pdf, original-name-002.pdf)
    - User can configure naming pattern before splitting
  - **Metadata Preservation**:
    - Replicate all editable metadata (title, subject, keywords, author) to each split file
    - Preserve system metadata where applicable (creator, producer)
    - Option to customize metadata per split file before execution
  - **Future Enhancement**: AI suggests split points based on document structure
- **Processing tracking**: Automatically mark processed documents in file metadata
  - Track processing count: Increment counter stored in metadata (e.g., custom field or tag)
  - Option to append note to subject field (e.g., "Processed 2025-01-10")
  - Option to add processing tag to keywords (e.g., "pdf-processed-20250110" or "pdf-processed-3" for 3rd processing)
  - Store both date and count in metadata so file itself shows processing history
  - Configurable format for date stamps and count display
  - Toggle on/off per processing session
- **Duplicate detection**: Identify duplicate documents based on content or metadata
  - Basic: Compare file hashes and metadata
  - Advanced: Content similarity analysis

**Phase 2: AI & Content Enhancement**
- **AI-assisted organization**: LLM analyzes document content and suggests:
  - Filename suggestions (based on content, dates, document type)
  - Title suggestions (concise, descriptive titles)
  - Subject suggestions (categorization)
  - Keyword/tag suggestions (aligned with taxonomy)
  - Split point suggestions (detect document boundaries in multi-page PDFs)
  - Basic: Single document analysis with all suggestion types
  - Batch: Process multiple documents with progress tracking
- **OCR text extraction**: Extract text from scanned PDFs for better AI context
  - Basic: Extract text and display in preview
  - Advanced: Use extracted text for AI suggestions (filename, title, tags, split points)
- **AI prompt optimization**: Continuously improve prompts for better suggestions
  - A/B testing framework for prompts
  - User feedback loop for suggestion quality
  - Separate prompt optimization for each suggestion type (filename vs. title vs. tags vs. splits)

### Medium Priority (Workflow Enhancement)

**Phase 3: Batch Processing**
- **Batch metadata operations**: Apply metadata changes to multiple selected documents
  - Bulk tag addition/removal
  - Bulk title/subject updates
  - Pattern-based renaming
- **Activity log**: Track document updates and metadata changes
  - Basic: Simple log of changes with timestamps
  - Advanced: Export log, filter by date/type, undo support

**Phase 4: Reporting & Analytics**
- **Basic reporting**: Document statistics and metadata completeness
  - Document count, tag usage, metadata coverage
- **Advanced analytics**: Trends, patterns, and insights
  - Tag frequency over time
  - Processing efficiency metrics
  - Export reports (CSV, JSON)

### Lower Priority (Advanced Features)

**Phase 5: Cloud Integration**
- **Cloud directory read access**: Point tool at cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
  - Read-only viewing and metadata editing
  - Sync metadata back to cloud files
- **Cloud directory write access**: Full bidirectional sync
  - Upload processed files
  - Manage cloud file organization

**Phase 6: Automation**
- **Autonomous batch updates**: AI agent processes multiple documents automatically
  - Configurable rules for auto-tagging
  - User review queue for AI suggestions
  - Scheduled batch processing
