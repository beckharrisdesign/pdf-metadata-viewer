# Feature Status Assessment

## Core Workflow ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Point application at directory of PDFs/images
- ✅ Application loads first document in queue
- ✅ User reviews document preview (multi-page support)
- ✅ User manually edits metadata (title, subject, keywords, author)
- ❌ Requests LLM analysis to suggest metadata values (Phase 2)
- ✅ User saves and moves to next document (circular navigation)

## Key Features

### Document Viewing ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Display PDF/image preview (multi-page with thumbnails)
- ✅ Show current embedded metadata
- ✅ Navigate through document queue with arrow keys/buttons

### Metadata Editing ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Edit title, subject, and keywords fields
- ✅ Tag-based keyword editor with add/remove functionality
- ✅ Keywords stored as comma-delimited values in PDF metadata
- ✅ File renaming (bonus feature)

### AI-Assisted Organization ❌ NOT STARTED
- ❌ LLM analyzes document content and structure
- ❌ Suggests values for: filename, title, subject, keywords
- ❌ Suggests split points for multi-page PDFs
- **Status**: Phase 2 - High Priority

### Tag Taxonomy ❌ NOT STARTED
- ❌ Lightweight database (markdown file) of standardized tag slugs
- ❌ People registry validation
- ❌ Vendor/provider registry validation
- **Status**: Mentioned in PRD but not yet implemented

### Activity Log ✅ COMPLETE (Implemented Early!)
- ✅ Track which documents were updated
- ✅ Record metadata changes
- ✅ Timestamp of updates
- ✅ Collapsible UI with auto-refresh
- **Note**: This was in Phase 3 but implemented early!

## Future Enhancements Status

### Phase 1: Essential Metadata Features

#### ✅ PDF Splitter Mode - COMPLETE
- ✅ Split button in navigation bar (visible for multi-page PDFs)
- ✅ Splitter view with page thumbnails in grid (3 per row)
- ✅ Click-to-insert break markers between pages
- ✅ Visual break markers
- ✅ "Split PDF" button executes operation
- ✅ Returns to main view after splitting
- ✅ Auto-numbering: Sequential (filename-001.pdf, filename-002.pdf)
- ✅ Metadata preservation (title, subject, keywords, author, creator, producer)
- ❌ User can configure naming pattern before splitting (not implemented)
- ❌ AI suggests split points (Phase 2)

#### ❌ Processing Tracking - NOT STARTED
- Track processing count in metadata
- Append note to subject field
- Add processing tag to keywords
- **Status**: Phase 1 - High Priority

#### ❌ Duplicate Detection - NOT STARTED
- Basic: Compare file hashes and metadata
- Advanced: Content similarity analysis
- **Status**: Phase 1 - High Priority

#### ❌ Editing Additional Metadata Fields - PARTIALLY DONE
- ✅ Author is editable
- ❌ Creator, producer editing (currently read-only)
- ❌ Custom fields editing
- **Status**: Phase 1 - Medium Priority (user tabled this)

#### ❌ XMP Packet Metadata Syncing - NOT STARTED
- Sync metadata in XMP packet format
- **Status**: Phase 1 - Future Enhancement

### Phase 2: AI & Content Enhancement ❌ NOT STARTED
- ❌ AI-assisted organization (all suggestion types)
- ❌ OCR text extraction
- ❌ AI prompt optimization
- **Status**: High Priority but requires OpenAI integration

### Phase 3: Batch Processing ❌ NOT STARTED
- ❌ Batch metadata operations
- ✅ Activity log (implemented early!)
- **Status**: Medium Priority

### Phase 4: Reporting & Analytics ❌ NOT STARTED
- **Status**: Medium Priority

### Phase 5: Cloud Integration ❌ NOT STARTED
- **Status**: Lower Priority

### Phase 6: Automation ❌ NOT STARTED
- **Status**: Lower Priority

## Summary

### ✅ Completed Features (Core MVP + Extras)
1. **Core Workflow**: Fully functional document viewing and metadata editing
2. **PDF Splitter**: Complete implementation with metadata preservation
3. **Activity Logging**: Implemented early (was Phase 3)
4. **File Renaming**: Bonus feature not in original PRD
5. **Multi-page Preview**: Enhanced beyond basic preview

### 🎯 Next Priority Features (Based on PRD)
1. **Processing Tracking** (Phase 1) - Mark processed documents
2. **Duplicate Detection** (Phase 1) - Identify duplicate files
3. **AI-Assisted Organization** (Phase 2) - LLM suggestions for metadata
4. **Tag Taxonomy Validation** (Core Feature) - Validate keywords against taxonomy

### 📊 Completion Status
- **Core Features**: ~85% complete (missing AI and taxonomy validation)
- **Phase 1**: ~40% complete (splitter done, processing tracking and duplicates pending)
- **Phase 2**: 0% complete (AI features not started)
- **Phase 3+**: Activity log done early, rest pending

### 💡 Recommendations
1. **Processing Tracking** would be a natural next step - helps track workflow progress
2. **Tag Taxonomy** should be implemented before AI features to validate suggestions
3. **AI-Assisted Organization** is the biggest workflow enhancement but requires OpenAI integration
4. Consider implementing **duplicate detection** early to avoid processing duplicates
