## Summary

- **Successfully tested:** 4/5 PDFs
- **Total attempts:** 12
- **Successful attempts:** 12
- **Average Score:** 35.6/40 (89.0%)
- **Score Range:** 33-37/40

### Score Distribution:
- **Excellent (35-40):** 10 attempts (83.3%)
- **Good (28-34):** 2 attempts (16.7%)
- **Acceptable (20-27):** 0 attempts
- **Needs Improvement (<20):** 0 attempts

### Common Issues Across All Tests:

1. **Filename Format (Most Common):** All 12 attempts missing em dashes (—). Using regular dashes or hyphens instead of the required format: `YYYY-MM-DD — Type — Subject/Vendor — Person`

2. **Invalid Tags:**
   - "529-plan" (not in taxonomy - should use "statement" or "financial")
   - "healthcare" (not in taxonomy - should use "medical" or "insurance")

3. **Duplicate Keywords:**
   - "financial" appears twice in Test 3, Attempts 2 & 3
   - "insurance" appears twice in Test 5, Attempt 2

4. **Missing Tags:**
   - Test 5 missing vendor tag "united-healthcare" despite being mentioned in title
   - Some attempts missing time period tags when dates are clear

### Strengths:

1. **Title Quality:** Perfect scores (5/5) across all attempts
2. **Subject Quality:** Perfect scores (5/5) across all attempts - all within 10-word limit
3. **Keywords Format:** Perfect scores (5/5) - all properly formatted (comma-separated, lowercase, no spaces)
4. **Overall Accuracy:** Perfect scores (5/5) - excellent consistency across fields
5. **Taxonomy Compliance:** Very high (4-5/5) - mostly using valid taxonomy tags

### Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:

1. **Emphasize em dashes (—) in filename format** - This is the most consistent issue
2. **Clarify taxonomy tag usage** - Specifically mention not to invent tags like "529-plan" or "healthcare"
3. **Add instruction to remove duplicates** - Check for duplicate tags before returning
4. **Emphasize vendor tag inclusion** - When vendor is mentioned in title/filename, include vendor slug in keywords
5. **Add time period tags** - When date is clear in filename, include year-YYYY and month-MM tags
